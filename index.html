            <p>MUMBAI – In a startling revelation, insiders from the Maharashtra state government have claimed that Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar accessed confidential budget files just days before the official budget announcement scheduled for next week. The allegations have sparked concerns over transparency and the integrity of the budgetary process in the state.</p>

            <p>Sources close to the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, revealed that Pawar was seen reviewing sensitive documents in his office late last week. "He had stacks of files on his desk, and it was clear he was going through the budget details," one insider told us. "This is highly unusual, as the budget is supposed to remain under wraps until the official presentation in the assembly."</p>

            <h2>Opposition Demands Investigation</h2>
            <p>The opposition parties have seized the opportunity to criticize the ruling coalition, demanding an immediate investigation into the matter. "If these allegations are true, it’s a serious breach of protocol," said Sanjay Raut, a senior leader from Shiv Sena (UBT). "The budget process must be transparent, and no one, not even the Deputy CM, should have access to it before the announcement."</p>

            <p>The state budget, which outlines the government’s financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, is a closely guarded document. Traditionally, only a select group of officials in the finance department have access to the details until the budget is presented in the legislative assembly. Any premature access could potentially lead to leaks, favoritism, or undue influence on policy decisions.</p>

            <h2>Pawar’s Office Denies Allegations</h2>
            <p>Ajit Pawar’s office has categorically denied the claims, calling them "baseless" and "politically motivated." In a statement released on Monday, a spokesperson for the Deputy CM said, "Mr. Pawar is committed to the highest standards of governance. The allegations are an attempt to tarnish his image ahead of the budget session. He has not accessed any confidential budget files."</p>

            <p>However, the denial has done little to quell the growing controversy. Political analysts suggest that this incident could further strain the already fragile relationship between the coalition partners in the Maharashtra government. Pawar, a key figure in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), has often been at the center of political storms, and this latest development only adds fuel to the fire.</p>

            <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
            <p>As the budget announcement approaches, all eyes will be on the state assembly to see if these allegations impact the proceedings. The opposition has vowed to raise the issue during the session, and there are calls for an independent probe to ensure the integrity of the budgetary process.</p>

            <p>For now, Ajit Pawar remains tight-lipped on the matter, but the controversy is unlikely to die down anytime soon. With the budget set to be a critical one for the state—focusing on infrastructure, agriculture, and economic recovery post-pandemic—this incident has cast a shadow over what was expected to be a pivotal moment for the government.</p>
